Maven Goals
----------------------
=> Goals are nothing but commands
=> All maven goals will start with 'mvn'

1. Clean: It will delete a folder which is known as Target folder.
		Target folder consists of the jar/war files
Syntax: mvn clean

2. Compile: It will compile the source code of the application. (.java ------> .class)
Syntax: mvn compile

3. Test: It will perform the unit test execution of the source code
Syntax: mvn test

4. Package: To package the project as a jar or war file
Syntax: mvn package
When we execute the above goal, it will create the TARGET Folder, inside which jar or war file will be available based on the type of application.

5. Install: To install the project as a dependency in the local repo.
Syntax: mvn install

Process: .java ----> .class ----> Package (jar/war) ----> mvn package ----> Target folder will get created

Note: Multiple maven goals can be executed at a time. (Syntax: mvn compile package)
Note: All maven goals should be executed from the path wherever the 'pom.xml' file is available
